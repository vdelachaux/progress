#progress

A simple platform-dependant implementation of a class-driven progress dialog

* The dialog box is managed by a worker, which disconnects it strongly from your code and doesn't slow it down. 

* You can set a delay during which progress will not be displayed. In this way, the progress dialog will only be displayed if the processing time exceeds the time you have set.

* Generic icons are provided for your convenience, but you can of course use any you like.

### Sample code

```4d
var $progress : cs.progress
$progress:=cs.progress.new()$progress.title:="Copy files"$progress.icon:="check"$progress.message:="We're doing something..."// Do something$progress.Close()
```

ðŸ“Œ See the [class documentation](Documentation/Classes/progress.md)Â that describe properties & functions.

ðŸ“Œ Don't forget to open and run the **HDI_xxx** methods, where the commented code teaches you all the possibilities.
